# Polyscripted PHP

## Maintained by Polyverse Corporation

This Repository contains the upstream PHP Docker
containers along with open source extensions under the
[/polyverse](/polyverse) directory. All extensions, when not falling 
under the PHP license are by default granted under the Apache 2.0 license.

Ultimately this repository modifies PHP to have a Polyscripting
capability.

it matters, visit the [Polyscripting Homepage](https://polyverse.com/polyscripting)
